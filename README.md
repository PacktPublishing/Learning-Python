This is the code repository for [Learning Python](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/learning-python), published by Packt.

**Learn to code like a professional with Python**

## What is this book about?
Learning Python has a dynamic and varied nature. It reads easily and lays a good foundation for those who are interested in digging deeper. It has a practical and example-oriented approach through which both the introductory and the advanced topics are explained. Starting with the fundamentals of programming and Python, it ends by exploring very different topics, like GUIs, web apps and data science. The book takes you all the way to creating a fully fledged application.

The book begins by exploring the essentials of programming, data structures and teaches you how to manipulate them. It then moves on to controlling the flow of a program and writing reusable and error proof code. You will then explore different programming paradigms that will allow you to find the best approach to any situation, and also learn how to perform performance optimization as well as effective debugging. Throughout, the book steers you through the various types of applications, and it concludes with a complete mini website built upon all the concepts that you learned.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Get Python up and running on Windows, Mac, and Linux in no time
* Grasp the fundamental concepts of coding, along with the basics of data structures and control flow.
* Write elegant, reusable, and efficient code in any situation
* Understand when to use the functional or the object oriented programming approach
* Create bulletproof, reliable software by writing tests to support your code
* Explore examples of GUIs, scripting, data science and web applications
* Learn to be independent, capable of fetching any resource you need, as well as dig deeper
