# the problem
>>> vision = (9.5, 8.8)
>>> vision
(9.5, 8.8)
>>> vision[0]  # left eye (implicit positional reference)
9.5
>>> vision[1]  # right eye (implicit positional reference)
8.8


# the solution
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Vision = namedtuple('Vision', ['left', 'right'])
>>> vision = Vision(9.5, 8.8)
>>> vision[0]
9.5
>>> vision.left  # same as vision[0], but explicit
9.5
>>> vision.right  # same as vision[1], but explicit
8.8


# the change
>>> Vision = namedtuple('Vision', ['left', 'combined', 'right'])
>>> vision = Vision(9.5, 9.2, 8.8)
>>> vision.left  # still perfect
9.5
>>> vision.right  # still perfect (though now is vision[2])
8.8
>>> vision.combined  # the new vision[1]
9.2
